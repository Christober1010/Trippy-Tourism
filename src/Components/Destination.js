                <p className="text-start mx-4">Taal Volcano is a large caldera in Batangas that was formed by prehistoric eruptions. In the wake of the eruptions, it was eventually filled by Taal Lake. Throughout history it has erupted about 38 times, making it the second most active volcano in the Philippines. While it is usually known to only have one crater, the volcano is actually a complex volcano system that consists of 47 volcanic craters. Its most popular crater is the Binintiang Malaki cone on the volcano's northwestern tip. This now dormant crater is also what you can see from nearby Tagaytay City and nearby towns. Meanwhile, its Main Crater Lake is the biggest crater in the system. This lake used to contain a small island called Vulcan Point, but it eventually disappeared after the main crater had a Phreatomagmatic eruption in 2020. A phreatomagmatic eruption is caused by the interaction of magma and water</p>

                <p className="text-start mx-4">Bali packs a lot into one small island— from breathtaking waterfalls like Sekumpul in the north to the white sand beaches of Nyang Nyang in the south. Whatever you’re seeking, you’ll probably find: surf-able waves in Batu Bolong, all-night clubs in Seminyak, luxury clifftop hotels in Nusa Dua, and spiritual refuges all around. Snap a pic at the Gateway to Heaven, cut through the jungle to the hidden Gunung Kawi Temple, and catch the sunset and a traditional fire dance at Uluwatu Temple. Just don’t miss the markets—hunt for handcrafted artwork and textiles at the Sukawati Art Market, or snack on street food staples like satay and bakso at the Sindhu Night Market.
